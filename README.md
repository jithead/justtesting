This is a small demo project showing how to build a basic website with user sign up and login functionality using only Node's built-in modules.

## Running the server

Run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server listens on port 3000 by default. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the site.

User data is stored in `users.json` in the project directory.
